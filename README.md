#### A Microservices API Gateway Built Using Typescript
----

Proxy Gateway is an API gateway that hovers over microservices or serverless architecture. It is completely dissociated from the stack used for the other services. It secures and exposes your services with a complete control over all its functionality and behaviour.

This can be extended by creating or adding express middlewares.

This repository exposes an API interface to manage these routs. A frontend interface (initially in angular) will help you manage your gateway. Being built as a library will help you integrate it easily within any js interface.
